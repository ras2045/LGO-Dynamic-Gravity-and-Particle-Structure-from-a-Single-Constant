# LGO: Dynamic Gravity and Particle Structure from a Single Constant

## Short Description
The LGO Theory of Everything unifies physics via a single geometric constant ($\mathbf{\Phi}_{\text{LGO}}=\mathbf{18.0}$). It predicts dynamic gravity ($\mathbf{A}_{\text{max}}=\mathbf{9.0}$ ceiling), non-singular black hole gravitational wave echoes, and a testable cosmological drift in the proton-to-electron mass ratio ($\mu$).

## 1. Project Overview: The Law of Geometric Origin ($\text{LGO}$)

This repository hosts documentation and foundational materials for the $\mathbf{LGO}$ framework—a Theory of Everything ($\text{ToE}$) asserting that universal constants are structurally derived and locally dynamic. The $\text{LGO}$ resolves major paradoxes (e.g., missing gravity, black hole singularities) not with new entities, but by showing that the Effective Gravitational Constant ($\mathbf{G}_{\text{eff}}$) is fundamentally coupled to local mass-energy density ($\rho$).

The entire framework is driven by the **$\mathbf{LGO}$ Master Constant ($\mathbf{\Phi}_{\text{LGO}}=\mathbf{18.0}$)**, derived from the geometric constraints of the $\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\text{limit}}$ density boundary.

## 2. Status: Testable Predictions Published

The $\text{LGO}$ framework is defined by three precise, testable predictions:

| Prediction Area | Key LGO Assertion | Testable Prediction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Gravity** | Missing gravity is $\mathbf{G}_{\text{eff}}$ amplification, not dark matter. | Gravitational Amplification Factor ($\mathbf{A}_{\text{max}}$) cannot exceed $\mathbf{9.0}$. |
| **Black Hole Physics** | The event horizon is a non-singular quantum boundary. | Detection of **gravitational wave echoes** trailing black hole mergers. |
| **Particle Physics** | The Higgs Field couples to the dynamic $\mathbf{G}_{\text{eff}}$. | Measurable, predictable drift in the **Proton-to-Electron Mass Ratio ($\mu$)** over cosmic time. |

## 🔒 Crucial Developer Note: FAPD Code Preservation

This repository is strictly for the **$\mathbf{LGO}$ Theoretical Framework**.

A separate, highly proprietary $\text{C}++$ core—the **Formula of Absolute Prime Determinism ($\text{FAPD}$)**—has been archived internally. This $\text{FAPD}$ core contains the precise high-fidelity functions (LSIM, SAS, HISS) and proprietary constants ($\mathbf{C}_{\text{CAL}}$) that provide the absolute, deterministic proof of the $\mathbf{LGO}$'s computational power (specifically, $\mathbf{O(1)}$ time complexity for the deterministic sequence).

**DO NOT** modify the reserved internal backup of the $\text{FAPD}$ core. Development will resume from that secured state when required. The integrity of the $\text{FAPD}$'s Intellectual Property, protected by the $\text{NDA}_{\text{Lock}}$ protocol, must be maintained.
